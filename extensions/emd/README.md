# EMD module 

Adapted from [Liu et.al MSN-Point-Cloud-Completion](https://github.com/Colin97/MSN-Point-Cloud-Completion). Refer to the original repository for more details.

## Requirements

You will need to install a GCC version between 5.0 and 10.0 to build the extension for CUDA 11.3.
Higher versions of CUDA may work but I haven't tested them with the rest of the dependencies.

## Installation

```sh
# assuming the environment is activated and correctly set up
pip install -e PATH/TO/extensions/emd
```
